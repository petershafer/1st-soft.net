<p>Hello, my name is Peter Shafer, the owner of 1st-Soft.net.  1st-Soft.net no longer serves any particular purpose, I had bought the domain to be able to share my first software and game creations on the web.  If you would like to contact me, you can use the following e-mail address to contact me.<br/><br/>hello8[at]1st-soft[dot]net<br/><br/>If that doesn't make sense, here's an example.<br/>name@domain.com = name[at]domain[dot]com<br/><br/>I'm also on facebook, so you can track me down there as well.</p>
