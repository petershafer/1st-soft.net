<h1>Google Docs Download</h1>

<p>Users of Google's document and spreadsheet web service can easily access and manage their important documents in one central location.
They still would like to be able to back up and archive their files on their own systems.  Unfortunately that isn't so easy.  You would
have to open each document and choose to export them individually and becomes quite time consuming if you have more than a handful of
documents. <img src="psy.gif" style="vertical-align:text-top;" alt="emoticon" /></p>

<p>The Google Download Script was written to help streamline this process when combined with a download manager like 
<a href="http://www.downthemall.net">DownThemAll</a>.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<div style="width:120px; float:right; margin:0px 10px;">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-9350158916481986";
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 240;
google_ad_format = "120x240_as_rimg";
google_cpa_choice = "CAAQ_fCXhAIaCM3ZaPrxIggYKPG193MwAA";
google_ad_channel = "7262706154";

<p>Google Doc Download can be installed as a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net">Grease Monkey</a> script 
or a Firefox extension.  Once installed here is what you see on your google documents control panel.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="s1b.png" alt="screen shot 1" /></p>

<p style="clear:right;">Just navigate to the document list that you wish to download.  Selected the documents you want to download
by clicking their checkboxes or click the select: all link at the bottom of the page.  
Click the drop down menu on the right side of the page that reads "Download Your Documents" and select a format.
You can also choose to select all of your documents without selecting them by checking the "All Docs" option at the top of the drop-down.
A new window will open and you now have a list of links
to download all of the documents that you selected.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="s2b.png" alt="screen shot 2" /></p>

<p>Now use <a href="http://www.downthemall.net">DownThemAll</a> to mass download your 
documents!  You have now mass downloaded your documents from google, can now archive them to the medium of your choosing and place
it under your mattress so you can sleep at night knowing that if google exploded while you were sleeping you would still have your files when
you wake up.

<h2>Bugs &amp; Contact</h2>

<!--
<p>GDD malfunctions and is unavailable when Google Gears is enabled.</p>
-->
<!--
<p><b>"Google Apps for Your Domain" Users:</b> Please be aware that the new "download all docs" option is not available at this time.  
GDD's original features have not changed though.</p>
-->
<p>Remember to scroll to the bottom of your doc list if you have more than 50 documents.  Google streams this list as you scroll down.  If you wish to download all of your documents without having to scroll, turn on the "All Docs" in the GDD drop-down menu.</p>

<!--
<p>The drop down menu may seem to disappear if your browser size is too small or resolution is too low.  It should not be a problem unless
your screen/browser size is 800 x 600 or smaller.</p>
-->
<p><b>Please Note:</b> Certain file formats are not supported for either documents or spreadsheets.  Whenever this is the case you will
download the next closest format instead.  For instance, the text and CSV formats are supported for spreadsheets, but not for documents.  In
these cases you will download documents in RTF format instead.</p>

<p>This script can become temperamental depending on how Google decides to upgrade their code.  So if the page html or javascript changes
significantly then this script is liable to cease functioning.  Chances are I will find out pretty quickly since I use the script
myself but you can always drop me a line at <b>gdd at 1st-soft.net</b>.</p>

<p>This is also my first Grease Monkey script, so let me know if I messed up something in the gm configuration as well.
