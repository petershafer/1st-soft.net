<h1>Google Doc Download GM Script (Updated May 23rd, 2007)</h1>

<p>Users of Google's document and spreadsheet web service can easily access and manage their important documents in one central location.
They still would like to be able to back up and archive their files on their own systems.  Unfortunately that isn't so easy.  You would
have to open each document and choose to export them individually and becomes quite time consuming if you have more than a handful of
documents. <img src="psy.gif" style="vertical-align:text-top;" alt="emoticon" /></p>

<p>The Google Download Script was written to help streamline this process when combined with a download manager like 
<a href="http://www.downthemall.net">DownThemAll</a>.</p>

<h2>How it works</h2>

<div style="width:120px; float:right; margin:0px 10px;">
<script type="text/javascript"><!--
google_ad_client = "pub-9350158916481986";
google_ad_width = 120;
google_ad_height = 240;
google_ad_format = "120x240_as_rimg";
google_cpa_choice = "CAAQ_fCXhAIaCM3ZaPrxIggYKPG193MwAA";

<p>Google Doc Download is written as a <a href="http://www.greasespot.net">Grease Monkey</a> script for use in 
Firefox.  Make sure you have both of these installed before you try to use
the script.  Once installed, the script will run anytime you access your Google Docs control panel.  Here is what you will see.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="s1.png" alt="screen shot 1" /></p>

<p style="clear:right;">Just navigate to the document list that you wish to download, select a format, and click download.  You now have a list of links
to download all of the documents from the current section (All, Active, Starred, Speadsheets, Documents, etc) in google docs that you are viewing.
Links will be generated for all documents in that section (even if the lists spans multiple pages).  The script does not look
to see what documents you select below, it just generates links for every document.</p>

<p class="img"><img src="s2.png" alt="screen shot 2" /></p>

<p>Now use <a href="http://www.downthemall.net">DownThemAll</a> to mass download your 
documents!  You have now mass downloaded your documents from google, can now archive them to the medium of your choosing and place
it under your mattress so you can sleep at night knowing that if google exploded while you were sleeping you would still have your files when
you wake up.

<h2>Download it</h2>

<p><a href="googledocdownload.user.js">Click here to download &amp; install</a> <a href="googledocdownload.user.js"><img src="hur.gif" style="vertical-align:text-top; border-width: 0px;" alt="emoticon" /></a></p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<p>May 23rd, 2007: The script was updated to reflect a tweak in the html of Google Docs.  Please update your script.<br/>
I'll probably convert this to an extension in the near future so that the update process is more streamlined.</p>

<h2>Bugs &amp; Contact</h2>

<p><b>Please Note:</b> Certain file formats are not supported for either documents or spreadsheets.  Whenever this is the case you will
download the next closest format instead.  For instance, the text and CSV formats are supported for spreadsheets, but not for documents.  In
these cases you will download documents in RTF format instead.</p>

<p>This script can become temperamental depending on how Google decides to upgrade their code.  GDD gathers link information by
scraping the javascript code and places the download link with a long xpath expression.  So if the page html or javascript changes
significantly then this script is liable to cease functioning.  Chances are I will find out pretty quickly since I use the script
myself but you can always drop me a line at <b>gdd at 1st-soft.net</b>.</p>

<p>This is also my first Grease Monkey script, so let me know if I messed up something in the gm configuration as well.

<p>Google Doc Download was written by Peter Shafer, student developer, in April 2007.  Contact: <b>gdd at 1st-soft.net</b><br/>
Thanks to <a href="http://www.plaidbuttonup.com/main/">F.D. Cleary</a> for helping me debug the script. <img src="emot-frogsiren.gif" style="vertical-align:text-top;" alt="emoticon" /><br/>

<h2>To do</h2>

<p>Create an extension.  Once this has been tested enough in the wild and I know Google's code doesn't change dramatically that often, then I'll
convert this into a Firefox browser extension.</p>
<p>Add other google docs hacks to the script.  I've been messing around with google docs code trying to find ways to only view published
or unpublished documents.  I think google docs is a great tool and I'll continue to seek ways to improve the user experience through
grease monkey.</p>
