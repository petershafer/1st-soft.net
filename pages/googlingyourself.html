			<p>A lot of websites and blogs have written about the importance of googling your name
			occasionally and seeing what comes up.  They also provide instructions on how to help
			improve what comes up with your name.</p>
			
			<p>When doing this, you should keep in mind that people that are trying to learn more
			about you will take note of other identifying information about you.  Your email address,
			screen name, website, etc.  All of these can then be used to do further googling and connect
			the dots about you and your internet activities.</p>
