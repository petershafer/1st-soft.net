			<p>If you use windows 2000 or windows xp with Nero 5 or 6 you will be frustrated to find that
			non-administrators cannot access your cd/dvd-rw drive.  Since its generally a good idea not to
			run your windows computer as an administrator you need to find a way to grant cd/dvd-rw priviledges
			to users.  That's not possible until you install
			<a href="http://www.nero.com/enu/downloads-utilities.html">Nero BurnRights</a> which adds an item
			to the control panel that will let you determine who can and cannot use the cd/dvd burner.</p>
