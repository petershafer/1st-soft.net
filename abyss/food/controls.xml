Each Section seperates the different
types of controls.  For instance, location
option tags are seperate from food type
tags.

Each control represents a button, or button
duo that can be switched.  The name represents
what will be on the button label.  The mode
determines whether to eliminate locations that
have that tag or locations that do not have that
tag.  (1 requires a location to have the tag, 0
requires that it does not.)  The tag field is the
name of the tag to look for in a location.  The
switch field is used in case you want to have buttons
for both 1 and 0 options while eliminating the
possibility of having both turned on at the same time.
