          <p class="style2">Coffee  and Culture through the Ages</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Goats,  Caffeine, and Ethiopian Coffee</strong></p>
          <p align="center">Coffee&rsquo;s  history is no less rich than its intoxicating flavor.  The potent  picker-upper appears to have its beginnings in early Ethiopia.<span class="style3">1</span>   Legend has it that while feeding his goats one day, a herder  observed them dancing as if bewitched.  He then noticed some of the  herd chewing on a local tree&rsquo;s red beans and leaves.  Curious, he  timidly popped a few berries into his mouth, becoming the first human  to experience a coffee-induced caffeine rush.  Happy and hyper, he  joined his goats in their bizarre dance.<span class="style3">2</span></p>
          <p> Though  this early account has a blatant lack of factual evidence, it does  capture the spirit with which coffee was received by the early world.   The Ethiopians always looked on coffee with magical wonder.  Perhaps  as early as 600 AD did these beans serve as a quick energy fix.   But  it was not until the the late 15th or early 16th  century that humankind adopted the process of roasting, grinding, and  brewing to produce today&rsquo;s palatable drink.<span class="style3">1 </span></p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Laws,  Lewd behavior, and Lavish Sacraments:  Coffee in the Middle-East</strong></p>
          <p> After  coffee drinking came to be a ceremonial practice in Ethiopia, it  quickly caught on in the Middle East.  Arabs cultivated coffee to  stave off sleep during midnight prayers.<span class="style3">2</span>      Even fortune tellers used coffee to bolster their clairvoyance.    During grind reading, a teller would analyze the residue in a  finished cup of coffee.  The fortune teller would then predict  clients' health and happiness by the pattern of their grinds.<span class="style3">3</span> </p>
          <p> Coffee  also served as an excuse to socialize.  In 1475, Kiva Han, the first  coffee shop in the world, opened in Constantinople.<span class="style3">4</span>  To say the  least, it was very well-received.  By the 16th century,  coffeehouses sprang up throughout the Arabian peninsula, bringing  together the masses for candor, conversation, and mischief.  These  shops' ambiance, however, differed greatly from today's caf&eacute;  atmosphere. </p>
          <p> Gambling,  criminal activity, and lewd sexual practices became commonplace in  the early coffee scene.<span class="style3">1</span>   Troubled by what they understood to be off-color behavior, political  leaders enacted a series of laws upon the beverage and its abode.  In  1511, governor Khair-Beg closed Mecca&rsquo;s coffeehouses and totally  banned the brew. Shortly thereafter, Sultan Amurat III,  so afraid of  subversive activity in early coffeehouses, had every coffee shop  closed and its owners tortured!<span class="style3">4</span>  Still, underground drinkers  persisted, and by the time the Ottoman Empire occupied Arab lands,  coffee emerged as one of the Turks&rsquo; most profitable exports.<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p> A  new, less taboo type of coffeehouse replaced the risqu&eacute;  establishments throughout Turkey.  Unlike their predecessors, these  Middle-Eastern coffee shops served as fashionable men&rsquo;s clubs,  where members satiated their appetites for intellectual and artistic  conversation.  In fact, many scholars believe these coffee clubs to  be forerunners of the Paris caf&eacute;s.<span class="style3">3</span></p>
          <p> With  its explosion in popularity came a wealth of new coffee customs.    From roasting the beans to serving guests, the Turks ritualized  coffee preparation.  Even today many Turkish girls still brew and  serve coffee for prospective in-laws to display their domestic  skills.<span class="style3">3</span>  The drink was so vital to their lifestyle that Turkish law  permitted a woman to legally divorce her husband if he could not  provide her with a daily coffee quota.<span class="style3">4</span></p>
          <p> Indeed,  the Ottomans prized the coffee industry so much that they forbade any  unroasted bean to leave the country.  For years, the Turks&rsquo;  carefully guarded monopoly made transplantation to other lands  impossible.  Finally, in the early 17th century, a Muslim traveler  managed to tape a few beans to his belly and sneak them out of the  border.<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p> These  beans took well to the fertile grounds of India.  Determined to bring  the coffee bean to their land, the Dutch transplanted one healthy  tree to the Netherlands in 1616.  This move brought coffee to the  West and heralded a soon-to-be coffee craze in Europe.<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p align="center"><strong> Coffee's  Sweet Spot in Europe</strong></p>
          <p> Though  initially believed to be &ldquo;the devil&rsquo;s brew&rdquo; in the West, coffee  soon fell into good esteem.  Pope Clementine took to the drink so  well that he encouraged Europeans to baptize it as a &ldquo;Christian  beverage&rdquo; to shirk off its Middle-Eastern heritage.<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p> In  1673, the first European-built coffeehouse opened its doors in  Bremen, Germany.  Another opened in Hamburg only four years later,  and within a decade, coffee shops spread throughout the German  countryside.  Coffee even found its way into the German city of  Vienna after the Turks' raid.  When  the foreign troops retreated, they left behind 500 sacks of raw  coffee beans, piquing Vienna's interest.  This failed military move  marked the beginning of world-renown Viennese coffee culture.<span class="style3">5</span> </p>
          <p> When  coffee first arrived in Vienna, the Turkish brew's bitter taste first  turned off the Viennese.  To <span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">accommodate</span> for their consumers' sweet teeth, coffeehouses began to add a variety  of sugary substances to make their drink more palatable.<span class="style3">1</span>  One  popular early concoction was the <em>Vienna Melange,</em> which was a  Turkish brew mixed with cream and honey.  When these and other sweet  ingredients became commonplace in <span lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">caf&eacute;</span>s,  coffee culture surged in Vienna, rendering it one of the most  distinct in all the world.<span class="style3">5</span></p>
          <p> Coffeehouses  worked their way to Italy in 1683, when the doors of Venice&rsquo;s <em>caff&eacute;</em> first opened.  England and France soon followed suit, and by the  early 18th century, caf&eacute;s became synonymous with brilliant  minds, artistic pursuits, and great food.  Balzac, Beethoven, and  Voltaire were just a few prominent coffeehouse regulars.  Johann  Sebastian Bach even performed his <em>Coffee Cantata</em> in a local  shop.<span class="style3">5</span>    It was, indeed, caf&eacute; conversation  that helped fuel and organize the French Revolution.<span class="style3">1</span>  What is now  considered to be a pedestrian drink forever changed the face of  Europe.  Who dares to guess how many intellectual, artistic, and  heroic accomplishments would never have seen existence were it not  for a hot cup of joe.</p>
          <p align="center"><strong>Perking  up the Daily Grind:  Coffee Comes to the Americas</strong></p>
          <p> After  its warm reception in Europe, it was only a matter of time until  coffee became commonplace to American life.  Once the Europeans  introduced coffee to Latin America, many natives started cultivating  the bean on their own estates.  Due to its superior transportation  system and use of slave labor, Brazil&rsquo;s coffee production dominated  world markets.  In fact, Brazil had such a large influence in coffee  production that until the end of World War II, it supplied three  quarters of the world coffee market.<span class="style3">4</span>  Because of these new  plantations in Central and South America, coffee, for the first time,  became a beverage for all classes.<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p> By  the 1870&rsquo;s, Americans were consuming six times more coffee than  Europeans.  This &ldquo;indispensable beverage&rdquo; emerged as a 20th  century staple of American life and has gained an even greater  following throughout the 21st.  While in America, coffee boomed after  the industrial revolution, coffeehouses remained a rarity for many  years.  Not until the 1970&rsquo;s did caf&eacute;s hit it big in the  U.S..<span class="style3">1</span></p>
          <p> Specialty  shop coffees and exotic roasts offered Americans an alternative to  pre-ground, tin-sealed beans.  The 1990&rsquo;s were a particularly  prosperous age for the bean, spawning coffee giants such as Starbucks  and Green Mountain.<span class="style3">1</span>    By the rise of the 21st century, coffee acquired such a following  that it could now be found in thousands of flavors and varieties  almost anywhere on earth. </p>
          <p> History  demonstrates that craving coffee is more than just a caffeine  addiction; as a caf&eacute; drink it helps satiate our thirst for  creativity, community, controversy, and change.  Whether to fan the  flames of a revolution, feed a groggy brain, or fuel an all-nighter,  coffee will continue to refill our cups and reawaken our minds. </p>
