          <em><img src="cappuccino.jpg" alt="Coffee" width="181" height="137" align="right" style="position: relative; padding-left:5px; padding-bottom:5px;" />          </em>
          <p align="left"><span class="style2">
          </span><span class="style12">Can Coffee be Healthy?</span></p>
          <p align="left"><em>Coffee helps people stay awake and focused &ndash; but can it be good for your health?  Although coffee has developed somewhat of a bad reputation when it comes to health, recent studies emphasize that it may actually have some surprising benefits.  In addition to potentially decreasing the risk of Parkinson&rsquo;s disease, Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease, suicide, and gallstones, clinical research highlights that coffee contains antioxidants and may also lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and cirrhosis of the liver.<span class="style4">1</span> </em></p>
          <p align="left"><em>These benefits do not imply, however, that coffee should replace other foods as part of a healthy, balanced diet. Enjoy one or two cups of coffee a day, and consult a physician for more information on coffee's health effects. </em></p>
          <p><span class="style11">Coffee contains antioxidants.</span></p><p>
  Many Americans do not eat a healthy, balanced diet &ndash; leaving coffee as the leading source of antioxidants along with some other drinks like red wine and lager-style beer.<span class="style4">2,3</span>  Antioxidants, substances typically found in fruits and vegetables and some meats and nuts, protect cells from the damaging effects of unstable molecules in the body.  These unstable molecules, called free radicals, could potentially lead to such diseases as cancer and cardiovascular disease.<span class="style4">4 </span></p>
          <p>The roasting process heightens the total antioxidant activity in coffee beans, and caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee possess similar amounts of antioxidants.<span class="style4">2,3</span>  A serving of coffee even contains more antioxidants than a serving of grape juice, blueberries, raspberries, or oranges, but coffee should not replace fruits and vegetables.<span class="style4">5</span>  Although scientists do not completely understand what components of coffee produce this quality, coffee does have a protective antioxidant effect.<span class="style4">3</span></p>
          <p class="style11">Coffee decreases the risk of type 2 diabetes.</p>
          <p>Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and is also called non-insulin dependent diabetes or maturity onset diabetes.  Individuals with this disease either do not produce enough insulin or have cells that cannot recognize insulin and utilize it as an energy source.<span class="style4">6,7 </span>Although type 2 diabetes has serious long-term effects including heart disease, blindness, and kidney and nerve damage, individuals can manage the disease and lead long, productive lives<span class="style4">.7</span></p>
          <p>Despite not understanding why coffee lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes, scientists have found that it does in fact decrease the disease in both men and women.  Also, caffeine may play a role in decreasing the incidence of type 2 diabetes because caffeinated coffee intake had a more pronounced effect on the disease&rsquo;s frequency than drinking decaffeinated coffee.  Data from several clinical studies support the relationship between coffee and a lowered risk of type 2 diabetes, and  further investigation is needed to clarify why coffee consumption produces benefits.<span class="style4">6,7,8</span></p>
          <p class="style11">Coffee protects the liver against cirrhosis.</p>
          <p>Cirrhosis is caused by chronic liver disease, which is commonly caused by long-term alcoholism or hepatitis C.  While alcohol injures the liver in such a way that it cannot metabolize proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, hepatitis produces liver inflammation over an extended period of time.  Scar tissue in the liver, a key characteristic of cirrhosis, blocks blood flow and prevents proper organ function.<span class="style4">9,10</span></p>
          <p>Several studies link coffee consumption and a decreased risk of alcohol-related liver cirrhosis.  These studies were performed with large groups of individuals and consistently illustrated linked a decrease in cirrhosis with coffee consumption.<span class="style4">11,12</span>  Coffee&rsquo;s anti-inflammatory properties may produce this health benefit.5</p>
          <p><em>As studies have shown, drinking coffee may have some surprising health benefits &ndash; but coffee should not substitute a balanced diet.  According to Dr. Rob van Dam, Harvard scientist and author of The Journal of the American Medical Association review, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t advise people to increase their consumption of coffee in order to lower their risk of disease, but the evidence is that for most people without specific conditions, coffee is not detrimental to health.&rdquo;<span class="style4">5</span>  Again, to find out more about how coffee can affect health, consult a doctor.</em></p>
