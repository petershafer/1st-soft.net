          <p><span class="style5"><strong>Business:</strong> Artist&rsquo;s Cup Caf&eacute;<br />
            <strong>Location: </strong>231 Chestnut St., Meadville, PA 16335<br />
            <strong>Telephone: </strong>814-337-8287</span></p>
          <p><em>The Artist&rsquo;s Cup Caf&eacute; is an intimate, old-fashioned coffeehouse nestled in the heart of downtown Meadville, PA.  The caf&eacute; serves top-of-the-line coffee and espresso, all fresh roasted, with homemade desserts.  The lunch and breakfast menu items are made from scratch every day, with experienced chefs creating delectable and unique salads, sandwiches, and soups since 2002.  Beautifully decorated, with live music on weekends and art shows next door, the Artist&rsquo;s Cup Caf&eacute; offers a true coffeehouse experience.</em></p>
          <p><em>Robin Mitchell owns, operates, bakes, and cooks at the Artist&rsquo;s Cup Caf&eacute;.</em></p>
          <p><em>How did you get into the coffee business?</em><br />
          I&rsquo;ve always loved coffee.  I love the coffeehouse atmosphere.  I thought it would be a good thing to get into.  My family business was carpentry, but I've been in the restaurant business since 1991.  I became interested in how Arabica coffee beans were different from others, and I wanted to learn more about exotic coffee, which lead me here.</p>
          <p><em>What is it like running a coffeehouse?</em><br />
          A nightmare (laughs).  It&rsquo;s very busy, but more fun than working in a restaurant.  Coffeehouses are very social; people can relax and converse, do office or school work, and strike up conversations with strangers.  It's kind of like a bar, but with much better ambiance.</p>
          <p><em>What are you thoughts on running a business in the Meadville area?</em><br />
          I like it a lot.  I've worked at Gilby's and Papa Corone's in Oil City, which were family-style restaurants.  Overall, both places gave me experience on how to run a business.  Really, I like Meadville better than any town I&rsquo;ve worked in before.</p>
          <p><em>Do you believe in fair trade?</em><br />
          Absolutely.  We only use fair trade coffee.  Fair trade makes it possible for the profits to go directly to the growers, who do all the work, rather than middle-men.  I think that's the way it should be, so the small people don't get walked all over.</p>
          <p><em>What do you think about coffee culture in America?</em><br />
          There should be more of it!  Meadville actually has a lot to offer in this area, and I like to sponsor local artists and musicians at the caf&eacute;.  It helps amateurs in the community get a start, and everyone enjoys it.</p>
          <p><em>What, in your opinion, is good coffee?</em><br />
          Fresh roasted coffee!  The fresher, the better.  My favorite drink is a white mocha with fresh-roasted espresso.  I would also highly recommend Ethiopian Sidamo, a coffee picked once a year from the only remaining wild coffee trees in the world.  Come by the caf&eacute; in July or August to try it and be amazed.</p>
          <p><em>If you wanted to convert someone who doesn&rsquo;t drink coffee, what would you say?</em><br />
          Try something sweet first.  In fact, try anything from the mocha line: white mochas, chocolate mochas, or caramel mochas.  You'll like it.  Or, try desserts with coffee ingredients and experience the taste in a milder way.  Maybe you'll end up wanting to drink coffee, too.</p>
          <p><em>Great advice.  Thanks, Robin.</em></p>
